''' Here are the functions used to create bark grams. Note - the data is not 0 padded prior to the stft, and any samples 
    in the last frame are truncated if it's not full. This is because we use a fixed length for the cnn and the 
    files are 0 padded or truncated prior to the barkgrams being calculated.

    ''' For a given number of bands, calculates the bark spaced cutoff frequencies from 0-24.9 barks (approx fs/2 at 
        44.1k. As we use triangular overlapping windows, each cutoff is a centre frequencie for the previous band, 
        so just take the cutoff frequencies to be centre frequencies. 

        We calculate n_bands+2 centre frequencies as the first and last are only used as cutoffs in the basis matrix.
